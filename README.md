# leaflet-challenge

My task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

I was tasked with creating a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from a data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The map includes:

- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

- A legend that will provide context for your map data.
